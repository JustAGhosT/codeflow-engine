# AutoPR Engine: Consolidated Modernization and Orchestration Plan

**Project:** AutoPR Engine - AI-Powered GitHub PR Automation Platform  
**Current Focus:** Quality Pipeline + Security Framework + Multi-tenant Orchestration

## Project Overview

AutoPR Engine is an AI-powered automation platform that enhances GitHub pull request workflows
through:

- Multi-agent AI systems with memory and learning capabilities
- Smart integrations with Slack, Teams, Discord, Notion, Linear, and Jira
- Advanced automation for PR analysis, issue creation, and workflow orchestration
- Quality gates and automated validation before merging PRs

## Business Goals (from Enterprise Orchestration Roadmap)

- Achieve 99.99% platform uptime for all tenants within 6 months
- Support 5+ major agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, Semantic Kernel) by Q3
- Onboard 10+ enterprise tenants in Q1 post-launch
- Reduce per-agent operational costs by 30% vs single-tenant solutions
- Ensure SOC2 and GDPR compliance for all tenant data

## Technical Architecture (merged)

1. Agent Orchestration Layer
   - Multi-tenant agent lifecycle management and framework-agnostic deployment
   - Intelligent request routing and zero-downtime deployment support

2. Memory & Data Layer
   - Tenant-aware memory (Memo0), vector database abstraction
   - Strong tenant isolation and data encryption

3. Observability & Management
   - Real-time metrics, centralized logging, alerting
   - Cost optimization, quota management, dashboards

4. Security & Compliance
   - RBAC, audit logging, SOC2/GDPR controls

## Implementation Phases (canonical)

This plan is organized into focused phases with detailed subplans:

1. Quality Pipeline Implementation — see
   [plan-phase1-quality-pipeline.md](plan-phase1-quality-pipeline.md)
   - Current Step: Implement Comprehensive mode (all static analysis tools)
   - Key Components: Tool abstraction, modes, CI integration

2. Security Authorization Framework — see
   [plan-phase2-security-framework.md](plan-phase2-security-framework.md)
   - Current Step: Implement authorization utilities and manager access
   - Key Components: Auth models, decorators, utilities, audit logging

3. Project Modernization (summary)
   - Extract interfaces, implement dependency injection, plugin system via entry_points/registry
   - Centralize cross-cutting concerns (errors, logging, config)

4. Platform Enhancement Integration (summary)
   - Extend platform detection with quality tool awareness and recommendations

5. Workflow Integration & Orchestration (summary)
   - Enhance workflows with quality steps, composition for complex checks

6. Build & Release Optimization (summary)
   - Consolidate pre-commit hooks, CI optimization, automated reporting

7. Monitoring & Analytics (summary)
   - Metrics collection, dashboards, trend analysis

## Repository Cleanup and Orchestration Roadmap (from top-level PLAN.md)

### Phase 0: Repository Cleanup (Week 1)

- Code organization: standardize modules and naming; remove duplicates (e.g., duplicate enums)
- Dependency management: audit, prune, and pin
- Test suite: improve coverage, fix flaky tests, add integration tests
- Documentation: update README, ADRs, contribution guidelines, API docs

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 2–5)

- Core orchestration: agent lifecycle, zero-downtime deploys, multi-tenant routing
- Multi-tenancy: isolation mechanisms, RBAC, self-service onboarding
- Framework integration: adapter interface, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, health monitoring

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 5–8)

- Memo0 integration: tenant-aware memory, caching, batch operations
- Observability: metrics, centralized logging, alerts
- Security & compliance: encryption, audit logging, SOC2/GDPR controls

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Weeks 9–12)

- Kubernetes: Helm charts, multi-tenant operator, autoscaling
- Cost optimization: usage analytics, quota, cost reporting
- Enterprise: SSO, custom routing rules, advanced monitoring

## Key Timelines & Next Steps (merged)

### Current Week Focus

1. Complete Comprehensive mode implementation (Phase 1 Quality)
2. Implement authorization utilities and singleton access (Phase 2 Security)
3. Begin integration testing across quality + security features

### Weekly Milestones

- Week 1: Quality and Security core components
- Week 2: Integration and initial testing
- Week 3: Documentation and developer tooling
- Week 4: Workflow integration and dashboards
- Week 5: Final testing and deployment

## Success Metrics (from top-level PLAN.md)

- 99.99% platform uptime; P95 latency < 100ms; 10k+ concurrent agents
- 30% cost reduction per agent; onboarding 10+ enterprise tenants
- 90%+ test coverage for new components; strong developer experience metrics

## Risks and Mitigations (from top-level PLAN.md)

- Performance degradation at scale → load testing, autoscaling
- Data isolation risks → strict isolation checks, audits
- Breaking changes for users → backward compatibility, detailed migration guides, support

## Detailed Task Backlog (appendix from autopr/PLAN.md)

The following detailed checklist is consolidated from the modernization and quality pipeline plan.
Refer to the linked phase documents for the authoritative implementation details.

1. Modernize Architecture for Modularity & Extensibility (SOLID)
   - Refactor `autopr/actions/` and `autopr/ai/` into smaller units and provider interfaces
   - Implement plugin entry points and registry; add validation and dependency management
   - Centralize error handling, logging, configuration, and performance hooks

2. Quality Pipeline Implementation & AI Enhancement
   - Modes: Fast (done), Comprehensive (current), AI-Enhanced, Smart
   - Tools: Ruff, MyPy, Bandit, Interrogate, Radon, PyTest, CodeQL, SonarQube; add JS/TS tools
   - Results aggregation, reporting, and CI integration

3. AI Action/Provider Abstractions and Orchestration
   - Standardized interfaces; Liskov-compliant class hierarchies; factory patterns
   - Memory/orchestration separation; error classification and recovery module

4. Workflow, Build/Release, Config, Testing, Docs, DX
   - Quality steps in workflows; pre-commit consolidation; CI reporting
   - Settings for plugins and quality modes; env-specific configs
   - Tests (unit, integration, property, contract); docs and guides; templates

5. Monitoring and Analytics
   - Extend metrics collectors; dashboards; alerts; performance tracking

6. Migration and Backward Compatibility
   - Migration plan and tools; backward-compat layer; validation and rollback procedures
