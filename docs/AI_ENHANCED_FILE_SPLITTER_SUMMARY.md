# Create splitter with default configuration
splitter = FileSplitter()

# Check if file should be split
should_split, reasoning = splitter.should_split_file("large_file.py", content)

# Split file if needed
if should_split:
    result = splitter.split_file("large_file.py", content)
    print(f"Split into {len(result.components)} components")
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
# Custom configuration for specific project needs
config = SplitConfig(
    max_lines_per_file=500,
    max_functions_per_file=15,
    max_classes_per_file=5,
    use_ai_analysis=True,
    confidence_threshold=0.8,
)

splitter = FileSplitter(config=config)
```

### With AI Integration

```python
from codeflow_engine.actions.llm.manager import LLMProviderManager

# Initialize with LLM manager for AI decisions
llm_manager = LLMProviderManager(llm_config)
