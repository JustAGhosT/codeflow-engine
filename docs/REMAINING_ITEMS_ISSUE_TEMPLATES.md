**Proposed Solution:**
- Validate GitHub token format (ghp_ prefix)
- Check required scopes (repo, workflow, read:org)
- Verify token is not expired
- Provide clear error messages for token issues
- Add token health check to startup routine

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Token format validation (regex pattern)

- [ ] Expiration check (if applicable)
- [ ] Clear error messages with remediation steps
- [ ] Unit tests for validation logic
- [ ] Integration tests with mock GitHub API
- [ ] Documentation in TROUBLESHOOTING.md

**Related Files:**
- Look for authentication/token handling in `autopr/` directory

### Issue Template: BUG-7 - Integration Retry Logic

**Title:** Implement Retry Logic for External Integrations

**Labels:** `bug`, `medium-priority`, `integrations`, `reliability`

**Description:**

**Problem:**
Transient failures in external integrations (Slack, Linear, GitHub API) may cause operations to fail unnecessarily without retry attempts.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- Add configurable retry attempts and delays
- Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable errors
- Log retry attempts for debugging
- Add circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Exponential backoff implementation (e.g., using `tenacity` library)
- [ ] Configurable retry settings (max attempts, base delay, max delay)
- [ ] Error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
- [ ] Structured logging for retry attempts
- [ ] Circuit breaker for persistent failures
- [ ] Unit tests with mock failures
- [ ] Documentation of retry behavior

**Integration Points:**
- Slack webhook calls

### Issue Template: BUG-8 - Webhook Signature Validation

**Title:** Implement Webhook Signature Validation

**Labels:** `bug`, `medium-priority`, `security`, `webhooks`

**Description:**

**Problem:**
Webhooks may not validate signatures from external services (GitHub, Slack, Linear), creating a security vulnerability where malicious actors could send fake webhook payloads.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement HMAC signature validation for GitHub webhooks
- Implement signature validation for other webhook sources
- Add configuration for webhook secrets
- Reject requests with invalid signatures
- Log signature validation failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] HMAC-SHA256 signature validation for GitHub webhooks

- [ ] Environment variable configuration for secrets
- [ ] 401 responses for invalid signatures
- [ ] Security logging for validation failures
- [ ] Unit tests with valid and invalid signatures
- [ ] Documentation in SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md

**Security Impact:** High - prevents webhook spoofing attacks

**Related Documentation:**
- `docs/security/SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md`

## High Priority Performance (2 issues)

### Issue Template: PERF-1 - Blocking I/O to Async Conversion

**Title:** Convert Blocking I/O Operations to Async

**Labels:** `performance`, `high-priority`, `async`, `refactoring`

**Description:**

**Problem:**
Blocking I/O operations (file system, database, external HTTP requests) may cause performance bottlenecks and prevent the application from handling concurrent requests efficiently.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Audit codebase for blocking I/O operations
- Convert file I/O to async using `aiofiles`
- Ensure all database operations use async SQLAlchemy
- Convert HTTP requests to async using `httpx`
- Update workflow engine to fully leverage async/await

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Audit report of blocking I/O operations
- [ ] Convert file operations to async (aiofiles)
- [ ] Verify all DB operations are async
- [ ] Convert HTTP requests to httpx
- [ ] Update tests to use pytest-asyncio
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (before/after)
- [ ] Documentation of async patterns

**Performance Target:** 30-50% improvement in concurrent request handling

**Related Files:**
- `autopr/workflows/engine.py` (partially done)
- File I/O operations throughout codebase
- HTTP client calls

### Issue Template: PERF-8 - Request Rate Limiting

**Title:** Implement Request Rate Limiting

**Labels:** `performance`, `high-priority`, `security`, `api`

**Description:**

**Problem:**
Without rate limiting, the API is vulnerable to abuse, DoS attacks, and resource exhaustion from excessive requests.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement rate limiting middleware for FastAPI
- Use Redis for distributed rate limiting (if multi-instance)
- Support different rate limits for authenticated vs anonymous users
- Add rate limit headers to responses
- Implement IP-based and token-based rate limiting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Rate limiting middleware implementation
- [ ] Redis-based rate limit storage (optional: in-memory fallback)
- [ ] Configurable limits (per endpoint, per user, global)
- [ ] Rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
- [ ] 429 responses with Retry-After header
- [ ] Whitelist functionality for trusted IPs
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Documentation in API_REFERENCE.md

**Suggested Library:** `slowapi` or custom middleware with Redis

**Rate Limit Defaults:**
- Anonymous: 60 requests/hour
- Authenticated: 5,000 requests/hour
- Per endpoint overrides (e.g., health check: unlimited)

**Related Documentation:**
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` - Rate Limiting section (already documented, needs implementation)
